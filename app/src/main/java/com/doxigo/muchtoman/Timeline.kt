 * container colour a shade off the unselected ones.
 *
 * The mark carries the category's own hue, on a disc of the same hue: a 1.6dp stroke is too
 * little ink to read as colour on its own, and the disc is what gives it area. The label stays
 * `onSurface` throughout — the colour is for finding the cell, never for reading it, so nothing
 * legible depends on a hue.
 *
 * Selecting takes the hue away rather than intensifying it, which looks backwards written down
 * and is right on the screen: «this one» is a thing the app says in exactly one colour, and a
 * grid where the chosen cell is merely a stronger version of its own colour has seventeen cells
 * all claiming it at once.
 *
 * Tapping writes immediately, so the colour landing over [Motion.fast] is the only receipt the
 * choice gets. It is the one authored moment on the screen; a snap reads as a redraw.
