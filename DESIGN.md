# DESIGN.md — the Wise-fa world (seed wise-fa-2026-08)

Recorded from the built app on 2026-08-21, after the redesign shipped. Ground truth lives in
[Theme.kt](app/src/main/java/com/doxigo/muchtoman/Theme.kt); this file says what the values
mean and which rules keep the system whole. The previous world (teal-green + gold on warm
paper) is retired; treat it as anti-reference.

## Identity

One pair carries the brand, fixed across both themes:

- **Forest** `#163300` family — the ground of the hero card, dark-theme fills, light-theme
  selection.
- **Bright green** `#9FE870` — the answer and the action. The hero total, every loud button,
  the dark theme's primary.

Two objects in Theme.kt sit outside the Material scheme on purpose:

- **`Hero`** — the answer's card, **flat, never a gradient**. Light theme: Wise's forest
  `#163300`. Dark theme: the scheme's neutral elevated surface with a hairline border —
  Wise's dark cards are neutral rooms the green visits, and a forest slab on near-black
  reads as olive mud (two earlier cuts proved it). The `accent` (#9FE870, the total),
  `mint` (growth — the same green, Wise's own rule) and `warn` (#FFB59F, the card's only
  caution) are fixed; `strong`/`muted` are green-tinted on forest and the scheme's neutrals
  in the dark. The lock screen and the widget keep the fixed forest full-bleed.
- **`Cta`** — `fill #9FE870` / `ink #163300` in *both* themes. Every "press this" pill:
  PillButton PRIMARY (every save, the review pill, the deck's primary answer) and the tab badge.

**CTA ≠ selection.** Selected states (segmented pills, chips, category tiles, tab indicator
context) use the scheme's `primary` — forest in light, bright in dark — so *press this* and
*this one* stay two different statements even when both are green.

## Color roles (Material scheme)

- `primary` light `#163300` / dark `#9FE870`; `onPrimary` is always the other of the pair.
- `primaryContainer` — soft green tint; action circles, tab indicator, empty-state discs.
- `secondary` — **amber caution** (light `#7A5900`, dark `#EDCB5A`): budget NEAR/CLOSE, the
  unconfirmed-row dot, «ارزش نداشت». Never green, never error red.
- `tertiary` — **gain, and only gain** (light `#1F7A40`, dark the brand green `#9FE870`):
  income figures, day nets, deposits, "بیشتر شده", goal met. The one Iranian-bank
  convention never traded.
- `error` — Wise-toned red `#A8200D` (light). Facts that need looking at, two-tap deletes.
- Light ground: **real white** background; cards `#F3F5EE` / panels `#EAEEE0` (gray with a
  green whisper); text `#131711`; muted `#59614F` — green-tinted, never flat grey.
- Dark ground: **near-neutral, not forest-tinted** — Wise's dark screen `#121511`, surfaces
  `#1C1F1A` / `#262923`, muted text `#A8AAA6` (Wise's neutral grey). Dark mode is its own
  neutral room the green visits; tinting every surface green is how the theme turns olive.
- Dark `primaryContainer` `#2A3A1D` with the bright green as its content — quiet dark chips
  (action circles, tab pill), never green slabs.
- Category hues are their own two fixed sets in CategoryIcon.kt, keyed by glyph, chosen by
  background luminance — they ride above the scheme and survive theming.

## Type

Modam variable only (`wght`, `wdth`); zero tracking everywhere — Persian joins break under
letterSpacing; tightness comes off the width axis. `ModamFigures` (width 90) for every
figure, always with `tnum`.

- **ScreenTitle** — 30sp Black, one voice for every root page.
- **SheetTitle** — 26sp Black, one voice for every sheet.
- Hero total: Black, autosized 28–60sp (20–34sp on دارایی's compact header), in `Hero.accent`;
  the words and exact digits always under it on خانه's card. Figures autoshrink, never wrap,
  never ellipsise mid-number.
- A signed figure with a magnitude or unit word sets the word a step down, at every size: 0.58em
  at display size (the transaction hero), 0.72em at row size (`signedFigure` / `SignedFigure`).
  At the digits' own size the sign reads as a dash joining two words («میلیون −۱»).

## Shape & structure

Radius scale: field 14 · card 18 · group 22 · sheet 28 · hero 34 · pill ∞.

**Containers hold money; activity flows.** The rule that decides a surface:

- Money that *is* somewhere — assets, budgets, goals, settings — sits in **bands**
  (`bandShape`: one grouped object, hairline-divided rows, the «+» row built in).
- **تنظیمات is an index; its settings are rooms.** The page is her card and three bands of
  doors — دفترت, برنامه, نگهداری — plus «درباره» with the site, and every switch, and every
  paragraph that qualifies one, lives on the page its door opens
  ([Settings.kt](app/src/main/java/com/doxigo/muchtoman/Settings.kt)). The lite edition adds
  one card under hers, on the hero's field with the page's only `Cta` pill: the way to the
  full edition's preview.
  One rule keeps the two legible: a **`primaryContainer` disc is a door**, a neutral
  **`surfaceContainerHighest` disc is a control**. It is the quiet chip, never `Cta` — «press
  this» keeps meaning one thing.
- Activity — the ledger — is **container-less**: day heading (13sp bold muted + the day's
  net), then plain rows on the paper. Each row leads with a 44dp circle in the category's
  hue at 16% behind its glyph; merchant 16sp SemiBold; category line under; amount at the
  end. The category sheet reuses the row with `showIcon = false` inside its band.
- **One title line for the root tabs.** دفتر, دارایی, آینده and گزارش‌ها set `ScreenTitle` on
  the same 48dp row 12dp under the status bar (`.title-line` / `.screen-head` on the PWA), so the
  title stays put as she moves between tabs; a room that writes something puts its add pill
  (`TitleAddButton`: «+ تراکنش», «+ دارایی») on that row. خانه alone opens on her greeting.
- The **hero is a card**, not a field: floats on the paper under خانه's greeting top bar or
  دارایی's title line, all corners `Radius.hero`. Transaction and deck pages reuse it via
  `HeroPanel` (it takes the glass inset and gutter itself).
- **دارایی opens like دفتر: its title line, then the hero, compact** — a deliberate second
  reading of the same object (`HeroCard(compact = true)`, `.home-hero.compact`): same
  `Hero.field`, `Radius.hero` and dark hairline, top padding `Space.l`; whose (the scope toggle,
  only with a family), then the compact total beside its dollars, then the freshness line —
  about a third of خانه's card. No greeting bar and no action circles on this tab (its one verb
  is the title pill); no label, words, exact digits, loans strip or change pill: خانه's card
  carries those. The lite edition keeps the greeting, the full card and its circles on دارایی,
  its only screen.
- **The hero ends on its freshness line**, whose 48dp target already holds ~13dp of air under
  the words, so the card's bottom padding is a step under its top (`HeroPanel(bottom = …)`:
  `Space.m` under `Space.xl`, `Space.s` under the compact `Space.l`). Full padding there read
  bottom-heavy.
- **The freshness line is the refresh control.** «نرخ‌ها: … پیش» under the total is a
  full-width, ≥48dp button (`FreshnessLine`, both platforms, and both readings of the hero) with
  a small pen-drawn ↺ (`ActGlyph.REFRESH`) beside the words. While a fetch runs it reads «در حال
  تازه کردن…», dims to 38% and spins its mark. There is no «تازه کردن» action circle; pull to
  refresh on خانه, دارایی and دفتر is the gesture for the same act. The PWA has no pull, so the
  line is its only control.
- **Action circles** (`ActionCircle`): 56dp `primaryContainer` discs with labels, fixed
  108dp cells clustered to the centre — same rhythm at any count: two on خانه («اضافه کردن»,
  «تراکنش دستی»). دارایی has none; the lite edition has «اضافه کردن» and «گزارش».
- **A row on آینده leads with what it is**: a budget with its category's disc, a cheque with
  the logo of the bank it draws on (`BankLogo`, 36dp, the disc's slot). Goals and installments
  have no such mark and lead with their name. A cheque's caution follows the budget's: the
  sentence in ink, amber on the countdown beside its figure, bold `error` only once the date has
  passed uncovered. A chip that names a bank carries its logo (`bank-chip`, `Chip(lead = …)`).
- **Choices, three tiers.** `SegmentedChoice` switches the screen (one in view at most);
  `ChipChoice` slices the data below it; `PillToggle` re-reads one figure (whose total, which
  unit) and sits on that figure's own line — the chosen word on a small pill, the others bare,
  drawn about 31dp and touched at 48. On paper the pill is `primary`, never `Cta`; on the hero
  it is `Hero.well` with `Hero.strong`, `Hero.muted` for the idle word.
- Tab bar: full-width floor on `surfaceContainerHigh`, hairline on top, M3-sized soft
  `primaryContainer` indicator pill, CTA-green badge. No shadow, no island.

## Buttons

**Every control that stands on its own is a pill** (`PillButton` / `.pill`); a bare line of
coloured text reads as a caption until it is tried. No `TextButton` anywhere. The voices:

- `PRIMARY` — `Cta`, the one commit on a surface.
- `TONAL` — the ordinary act. Its fill is a **wash of ink** (forest 9% light, on-surface 10%
  dark), not a fixed surface, so it stands off page, sheet and card alike; `surfaceVariant`
  vanished on cards (1.08:1).
- `DANGER` — the tonal wash in error ink: an act that loses something, quiet until armed.
- `ARMED` — error-filled, set only by `ArmedButton`, the app's one two-tap: the first tap turns
  the label into the consequence and the pill red, announced as a live region.
- `HERO` — the tonal pill on the green field.

**Two sizes, and only two.** `block` is a sheet's full-width answer (52dp, 16sp); in-place acts
are 44dp, 14sp (drawn; Compose and the browser give the finger its 48). `PillButton` takes no
size parameters and no CSS resizes `.pill`: a 2026-10 audit found sheet commits at 52, 56 and
60dp, a Material `Button` beside a pill under the same sheet, and the day stepper at 40dp/12sp —
one app speaking in five accents. Answers stack full width and all wear `block` (CTA, then the
way out, then the delete), so «انصراف» is never a size down from the commit it sits under. The one
family outside the two sizes is the title line (دفتر, دارایی) — the «+ تراکنش» / «+ دارایی» pill
(`TitleAddButton`), the paste and search discs,
«دسته‌ها» and the review pill — a 48dp toolbar on the neutral well, sized as one row; a 44dp pill
in it would sit visibly short of its neighbours.
Inside a card, routine acts share a row in equal cells and the one that loses something takes
its own full-width row, so its armed sentence always has room. A **door** that leads elsewhere
(the backup reminder) is a card with a chevron, not a pill.

**A commit never greys out.** It is `PRIMARY` from the moment the sheet opens, and a tap on an
unfinished form saves nothing: it lets go of focus (the keyboard was covering the words) and
raises a sentence under each field that is in the way — «مبلغش رو بنویس.», «دسته‌اش رو انتخاب
کن.» A dimmed button says *no* without saying *why*; a commit that sat tonal until the form was
complete looked like «انصراف» beside it. Dimmed (38% on both platforms) is kept for two cases
only: work in flight, whose label already says «در حال …», and a stepper at its end — «روز بعد»
beside «امروز».

## Spacing

`Space` scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 32 / 48. Screen gutter is `Space.xl` (20) — `edge` in
Ui.kt is the one place that number lives. Section gaps are `Space.xxl`; more air above a
heading than below it, everywhere.

## Motion

- `Motion.settle()` — critically damped spring (stiffness 340), the default for any moving
  value (budget bars). `Motion.press()` — stiffer spring for press-give: PillButton and
  ActionCircle scale to 0.97/0.94 on touch-down, from the frame the finger lands.
- `Motion.enter`/`exit` easings stay for enter/exit choreography. The one authored moment
  is the hero total sliding up on refresh. Nothing overshoots.

## Iconography

One pen (`pen()`: round caps, 2dp at 24, thinner in smaller boxes) draws everything: tab
glyphs, category marks, the person, the check, the plus, the receipt. Category marks are
Lucide's drawings (ISC, vendored as path data in `CategoryIcon.kt`, licence in
`assets/licenses/lucide.txt`) inked with that pen, so they match the hand-drawn tab bar; six
stay drawn by hand because no set has them (همسر's ring, the unknown dots, and the faces:
خرج اتینا's, مامان's bun, بابا's سبیل, پارتنر's heart eyes).
**No emoji as icons**
— empty states use the drawn glyphs on `primaryContainer` discs; settings rows use drawn
marks or real logos (banks on white plates). Settings rows borrow category marks (ENVELOPE, TAG,
STACK, SWAP, TRAY, HOUSE) plus `SHEET` (Lucide `sheet`, the CSV export's row), which is a row
mark only and never offered in the category picker.

## Standing rules the visuals must keep

- Words carry warnings; colour only confirms — and never contradicts: the freshness dot is
  `Hero.warn` whenever any caution sentence is on the card, `Hero.mint` only when connected
  and fresh.
- Figures truncate, never round up; large amounts are spelled out in words underneath.
- Charts run LTR inside the RTL page; gain is green in both themes.
- No gamification: no confetti, streaks, scores, or comparison.
- Widget and launcher carry the same pair (Widget.kt constants, `widget_bg.xml`,
  `ic_launcher_*`): forest ground, bright-green figure.
